**Introduction**

Until now, styling content with Tailwind CSS has been a challenge. By default, it removes all styling from elements like headings and paragraphs. This can be frustrating for simple content creation.

We've heard many complaints, with questions like:

> Why does Tailwind remove default styles?

We understand your frustration. Disabling Tailwind's base styles isn't the answer, though.

The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our solution. It adds a new `prose` class that you can apply to any block of HTML content to style it beautifully.
